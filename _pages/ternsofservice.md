  2. Click on "Agree and Start." After clicking, the user (from now on referred to as "members") is deemed to have agreed to the terms and conditions of the BONNECHANCE service and, if necessary, may accept the membership through additional authentication procedures. The member may save their name (nickname) and use it in the BONNECHANCE service.

Suppose you use it without a separate membership. In that case, the information you entered will not be stored on the BONNECHANCE server and will be held in the web browser cache for a certain period of time for the convenience of using the service.

In the following cases, we may restrict the use of the BONNECHANCE service, by not accepting the creation of the member's account, discontinuing the member's use of the BONNECHANCE service, or deleting the BONNECHANCE account entirely.
